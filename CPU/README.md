## CPU code of SketchFeature
The main.py demonstrates the process of loading a dataset and encoding it into SketchFeature. The sketchfeature.py code contains the definition of the SketchFeature class. The parameters of SketchFeature may vary depending on the desired size of the sketch and the feature to be encoded. This specific code encodes the packet size feature distribution within the range of 0 to 1500. This code can be modified to accommodate specific features, such as IPD distribution or TCP window size distribution.
